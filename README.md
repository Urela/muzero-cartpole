# MuZero - Cartpole
 Implementation of MuZero in Pytorch on OpenAI's gym CartPole environment.

Results
--------------------------
**DISCLAIMER**: this code is early research code. 
- Takes about 400 episodes to consitantly achieve a score of 200 on Cartpole-V0
- Takes about 350 episodes to consitantly achieve a score of 500 on Cartpole-V1.
- Not very stable.

Training on Cartpole-v0 
--------------------------
To train a model, run the main function: ``python muzero.py``.
